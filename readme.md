WindowsForum.com Diagnostic Tool

The WindowsForum.com Diagnostic Tool v2.0 is an advanced utility designed to gather a broad spectrum of system and diagnostic information to aid in troubleshooting issues on your Windows system. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functions and the types of logs it collects:

How to Run:

Download, extract, and run the WF Diagnostic Tool by right-clicking on the WF Diagnostic Tool executable and choosing 'Run as administrator'.

The WF Diagnostic Tool will automatically begin collecting a variety of diagnostic information, saving it to a folder named 'WindowsForum' on your Desktop. This process may take some time.

Upon completion, the tool will compress the collected files into a .zip file named 'WF-Diagnostics.zip', also located on your Desktop. Please review these files before sharing them online.
